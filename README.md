# crosswalk
Stata module to recode variable based on crosswalk table (bulk recoding)

`crosswalk` applies fast table-based recoding. Pre-defined
crosswalk tables are provided for common recoding tasks related to occupational
classifications.

To install `crosswalk` from the SSC Archive, type

    . ssc install crosswalk, replace

in Stata. Alternatively, install `crosswalk` from GitHub as follows:

    . net from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjann/crosswalk/main/
    . net install crosswalk, replace

Stata version 14 or newer is required. Furthermore, the 
[`moremata`](https://github.com/benjann/moremata) package needs to be installed
on the system:

    . ssc install moremata, replace
